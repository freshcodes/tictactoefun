# TicTacToe.fun

This is a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive) where you can play tic tac toe against the computer offline. It will save state and stats in local storage.

It also includes [Peer.js](https://peerjs.com/) to facilitate playing against a friend.

This was built primarily to explore progressive web apps and other technologies as time permits.
